To achieve the objective of containerizing and deploying the Wisecow application on a Kubernetes environment with secure TLS communication and an automated CI/CD pipeline, we can break down the tasks into the following steps:

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Dockerization
    1.Clone the Wisecow repository:

                 $ git clone https://github.com/nyrahul/wisecow.git
                 $ cd wisecow

    2 . Create a Dockerfile:
                   Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of the Wisecow application:


                     # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
                            FROM python:3.9-slim

                     # Set the working directory in the container
                            WORKDIR /app

                    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
                            COPY . /app

                     # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
                             RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

                    # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
                            EXPOSE 80

                    # Define environment variable
                            ENV NAME World

                    # Run app.py when the container launches
                            CMD ["python", "app.py"]


       3 . Build the Docker image:

                 $ docker build -t wisecow:latest .


       4 . Run the Docker container:

                 $ docker run -p 80:80 wisecow:latest 


2 . Kubernetes deployment :

        1.Create Kubernetes manifest files:
          Create a k8s directory in the root of the repository and add the following files:
                     "deployment.yaml"
                     "service.yaml"

        2. Deploy the application to Kubernetes:
 
                    $ kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
                    $ kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml

3.  Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
        1. Set up GitHub Actions workflow:
             Create a .github/workflows directory in the root of the repository and add the following workflow file 
                      "ci-cd.yml"
        
       2. Add GitHub Secrets:
            In your GitHub repository, navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and add the following secrets:

            'DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME'
            'DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD'
            'KUBE_CONFIG'

4.  TLS Implementation
      1. Generate TLS certificates:
            You can use Lets Encrypt for TLS certificates. For a more detailed setup, refer to the Kubernetes documentation on setting up TLS:
                  $ kubectl create secret tls wisecow-tls --cert=path/to/tls.crt --key=path/to/tls.key

      2. Update Kubernetes manifests for TLS:
                "imgress.yaml"

      3.  Deploy Ingress:
                 $ kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml

Final Steps:
--> Commit all your changes to the GitHub repository.
--> Push your code to GitHub, triggering the CI/CD pipeline.
By following these steps, you will have successfully containerized the Wisecow application, deployed it to a Kubernetes environment with a CI/CD pipeline, and secured it with TLS communication.
